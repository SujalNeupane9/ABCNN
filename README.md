# ABCNN
ABCNN is a type of neural network architecture that utilizes attention mechanisms to present relationship between pairs of 
text sequences. The ABCNN model is specifically designed for text classification tasks where the input data consists of two sequences of text, such
as a question and an answer in a question answering task.

The ABCNN architecture consists of two main components: the embedding layer and the convolutional layer. The embedding layer maps the input sequences 
to a dense vector representation, while the convolution layer applies a set of filters to capture different features f the input sequences. The output 
of the convolutional layer is then passed through an attention mechanism that calculates the similarity between the two sequences and produces a weighted representation of the two sequences based on this similarity.
